# Troubled-Waters
These shapes were used to analyse the challenges facing the coast for the Onward report 'Troubled Waters.' The 5km file maps the area of the UK using a 5km buffer around the Admiralty coastline. 

The 5km buffer was created by Alasdair Rae at Automatic Knowledge and the second was created by the author.
